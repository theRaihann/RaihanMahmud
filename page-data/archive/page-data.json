It can also attenuate, shift DC level, filter and control gain for conditioning High voltage Differential Input Signal for Low-Voltage ADCs. Moreover the system can do bridge balancing, Dc level control, Gain control for conditioning Pressure gauge signal.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-01","title":"28 Pins Arduino Board PCB","tech":["Altium"],"github":"https://github.com/theRaihann/28-Pins-Arduino-Board-PCB-using-Altium","external":"","company":"BUET"},"html":"<p>There are two microcontrollers placed on the board, ATMEGA328P and ATMEGA16U2.\nBoth RESET pins ( 16U2 and 328P ) are driven through an open drain buffer. This means: improved RESET quality and it adds an option to debug the microcontrollers through dWire.\nATMEGA16U2 can now be used as an universal AVRISP MKII programmer. Once you change the firmware, you can use it to program the onboard ATMEGA328P or any other board.</p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},
